# Logo_Analyser
Project timescale: December 2021-Febuary2022

**This project was intended as a "non-exam assessment" for my Alevel computer science**
**Not the finished project. Unfortunately, I did not push the finished project from the sixth form computer system and therefore no longer hace access to the final version.**

The intentions of this project was to allow a user to provide a logo to an application and then have the characteristics of the logo be returned. Final version could return: shapes, colours, business classification, and the words within a logo.
In this project I was to self teach an area of software engineering that I had interest in so I chose to use look into machine learning(ML), using what I could to perform morphemetrics (shape detection), and classification of businesses through ML,
